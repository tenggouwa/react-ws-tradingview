Then your available balance is 55 (=100-45) USDT, and the cross-margin ratio (which is account balance / total position value) is 100/（0.05*7000+0.2*500）=22%. If BTC price goes down to 6,000 USDT and ETH goes down to 450 USDT. the available balance is 100-1000*0.05-50*0.2 = 40USDT.

STAMP considers the correlation of all assets in each client’s account and  provides a margin requirement based on the overall risk exposure and likelihood of loss of each portfolio. In other words, diversified portfolio will have less margin requirement.Due to the mechanisms explained in 1, 2 and 3, STAMP enables each client to maximize his  utilization rate of margin while keep potential loss in check. The possibility of negative margin due to forced liquidation is extremely low under the mechanisms of STAMP. Also STAMP adopts a clearing fund system to cover the rare case of negative margin on certain accounts. This makes the possibility of “socialized loss” often seen on other crypto derivative exchanges almost 0 on CBOEX.The platform supports contract trading with 6 underlying assets including BTC, ETH, EOS, BCH, ETC, LTC.',

The loss will be equal or close to the equity balance of his/her futures account. A user may increase the margin or change the number of contracts to change the leverage multiplier. The higher the margin or the lower the contract number, the lower leverage multiplier and lower risk of forced liquidation.',
    content4_6_25: '4.3 Gradual forced liquidation of cross margin mode: In order to maximize our customers\' interests and avoid successive margin call caused by the huge fluctuation of a single crypto, we adopt gradual forced liquidation of cross margin mode. Once one user is given a margin call, we\'ll close his/her largest position in terms of loss. If still not enough, then we\'ll move on to the second largest one, until the live margin ratio is back to at least MMR level. The advantage of this method lies in that it can help customer reduce losses',
